Instructions: 

   We are uploading 5 files contains test cases 0 to 4. The files are contained in the tar 
   archive "input-assgn4.tar.gz".
   
   For example, to run your program on test case 3, run the following command on your terminal:
  
   ./a.out <in3

   I am assuming that the name of your executable is "a.out".
 
   The "<" operator in Linux takes the input for a program from the filename specified after it,
   instead of taking input from the keyboard.
              

0. Insert 1000 random numbers into the skip-list, and then find the median.

   Input File: in0
 
   Output:
	4892

1. Insert 1000 numbers into the skip-list, delete half the numbers, and find the median of the resulting tree.

   Input File: in1

   Output:
	9663

2. Insert 1000 random numbers into the skip-list between 0 and 30000. Find the 100th, 200th, 300th, 400th, 500th,
   600th, 700th, 800th, and 900th smallest numbers.

   Input File: in2
 
   Output:
	3237
	6240
	9141
	12041
	14658
	18349
	21770
	24490
	26943

3. Insert 1000 random numbers between 0 and 20000 into the skip-list. Next, insert 1000 random numbers between 20000
   and 40000 into the skip-list. Finally, insert 1000 random numbers between 40000 and 60000 into the skip-list.
   Find the 1500th smallest numbers in the resulting skip-list

   Input File: in3

   Output:
	30335 


4. Generate a sequence S of 1000 random numbers between 0 and 20000 in sorted order. First, insert the 500 numbers at odd positions in S 
   into the skip-list. Next, find the 250th smallest element. Next, insert the remaining 500 numbers at even positions in S into the skip-list.
   Find the 437th smallest element. Delete a quarter of the numbers. Find the 561th smallest element in the skip-list.

   Input File: in4

   Output:
